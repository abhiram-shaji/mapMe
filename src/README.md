Alrighty, let's dive into the Python project that's all about juggling MongoDB, SQLite, and keeping an eye on network traffic with mitmproxy. We've got three main heroes in this story:

1. **db.py**: This little gem establishes a connection to MongoDB and—ta-da!—prints out the version of the MongoDB server. 

2. **map_addon.py**: Here’s where the magic happens, folks! It handles the hustle and bustle of client connections, requests, and responses zooming through the network. Using SQLite, it keeps tabs on the network requests and client info. Plus, it's got a secret weapon—external APIs to scout out more deets on those mysterious IP addresses lurking in the traffic.

3. **mitm.py**: Last but not least, enter the `Map` class, the maestro of events triggered by mitmproxy, managing everything from client hellos to goodbyes, requests, and responses. And let's not forget the `Proxy` class, revving up the engine to start and run the mitmproxy server.

So, there you have it, the trio of tools making sure everything in the network plays nice.


### 1. db.py
This little script is like our gateway to MongoDB. Here’s what it does:

- **mongo_connect()**: Ahem, so we try to shake hands with a MongoDB server, setting a timeout because, you know, we can’t wait forever. If we get a warm handshake back (meaning the connection is successful), voilà, it fetches the server's version info and says "Hey, look what I got!" But if it’s a cold shoulder, oops, it's error message time. This function is our basic health check to make sure our MongoDB friend is up and running.

### 2. map_addon.py
It’s a bit of a multitasker, Here’s what it does:

- **SQLite Database Setup**: Sets up an SQL table `maps` to keep tabs on network requests—think client ID, where they’re from, IP address, and how chatty they are.
- **Global Variables**: Keeps a handy list of clients, ties the knot with the SQLite database, and also grabs the system's host IP and an API token, kind of like fetching secret ingredients.
- **client_connected()**: When a new client pops in, it updates the `clients` dictionary to track everyone uniquely—like a good host.
- **request()**: Sneaks into requests and tweaks headers if they’re headed to our system host. It’s our little detective, figuring out who’s knocking on our door.
- **response()**: Checks if our SQLite buddy already knows about the request. If yes, it bumps up the count. If not, it’s `save()` to the rescue, creating a fresh record.
- **save()**: Grabs all the juicy details about the client and request, even gets a bit of gossip (geolocation data) from an external pal (`ipinfo.io`), and tucks it all into the SQLite database.

### 3. mitm.py
 This script is the stealthy spy of network traffic:

- **Map Class**:
    - **init()**: Kick-starts the Map class, setting up shop for handling network events, laying out database connections, and sorting environment variables.
    - **client_connected()**, **request()**, **response()**: Like its buddy `map_addon.py`, it keeps an eye on network happenings, analyzing the flow and storing data insights in SQLite.
    - **save()**: Notes down every bit about each unique request, stashing away client info and request nitty-gritty.
    - **done()**: A chill spot for cleaning up or thinking over things after the proxy party ends.
- **Proxy Class**:
    - **start_proxy()**: Hits the gas on the mitmproxy server, picking the right host and port settings. It ropes in the `Map` class as an addon to manage the network traffic saga.

Together, these scripts form our network’s watchtower, analyzing traffic and gathering data, keeping a keen eye through SQLite, and maybe having a chat with MongoDB for extra data wisdom.r and analyze network traffic, storing relevant data in a SQLite database, and potentially interacting with MongoDB for additional data handling purposes.
